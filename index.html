           <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The PC is the most powerful gaming platform out there. A strong gaming computer has the potential for higher resolutions, faster frame rates, &amp; better visuals than current consoles can even come close to achieving. It can be very tempting to build your own gaming PC, but if you don't know where to start, it can also be quite intimidating and turn you off entirely. Thankfully, it doesn't have to be that way. PCs are much easier to build than they were in the past, &amp; while it's not as easy as putting together a Lego spaceship, you don't have to be scared of it.</p>
            <img src="images/gaming%20pc.png" alt="Gaming PC" width="400">
            <p>That's why I've put together this straightforward guide on how to build a gaming PC. It's intended for people who are a little wary of building their first PC or just need a little refresher of the steps to doing so. Iâ€™ll cover a lot from the prep phase and picking parts to the actual parts like the CPU, GPU, motherboard, CPU cooler, hard drive (&amp; yes, of course, which SSD you should throw in there) build and beyond. Of course, due to the current pandemic, many online stores are experiencing product shortages and shipping delays that could interfere with your PC build, so be sure to check the estimated delivery date when ordering from stores like Amazon.</p>
            <p>Actually picking your parts can be daunting, especially when you factor in compatibility &amp; power consumption. There are a lot of things to consider, partially because many of your components may rely on your CPU being either from Intel or AMD. Thankfully, <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">PC Part Picker</a> is an invaluable resource that you should absolutely refer to when building a PC. It makes it easy to stay within your budget &amp; lets you know if your components are compatible with each other--it'll even make suggestions if there are issues with your chosen parts.</p>
            <h2>Terms to know</h2>
            <p>Before you go out and buy your computer parts and and start putting your PC together, there are some terms you should know</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a class="list">GPU:</a> GPU stands for graphics processing unit; another name for a graphics card. This will handle displaying images on your PC. The more elaborate and complex these images are, the more power you'll need from your graphics card. The two big names in the graphics card game are Nvidia and AMD.</li>
                <li><a class="list">CPU:</a> The CPU (central processing unit, also known as a processor) handles all of the processes and calculations on your PC. For your PC, you'll choose a CPU from either Intel or AMD.</li>
                <li><a class="list">Motherboard:</a> The motherboard is where all of the components are installed, allowing them to work together and perform their functions properly.</li>
                <li><a class="list">SATA:</a> SATA is a type of connection, like USB, that is used for hard drives and SSDs to transfer data</li>
                <li><a class="list">PCIe:</a> PCIe is another type of connection, though it's most commonly used for graphics cards and M.2 SSDs</li>
                <li><a class="list">NVMe:</a> NVMe is a type of connection protocol that can be supported by M.2 SSDs. This provides much faster access to saving and accessing data.</li>
                <li><a class="list">M.2 SSD:</a> An M.2 SSD is a small stick that provides your PC with storage space. You can get a SATA-based M.2 SSD or a PCIe-based M.2 SSD, the latter of which can support NVMe.</li>
                <li><a class="list">RAM:</a> The RAM (or random access memory) is used to store data and information that is being processed by the CPU. The more RAM you have--paired with a good-quality processor--the faster your PC can perform its various functions.</li>
                <li><a class="list">Cooling system:</a> The cooling system is used to protect the CPU from overheating.</li>
                <li><a class="list">PSU:</a> The PSU (or power supply) supplies your PC and its various components with power.</li>
                <li><a class="list">OS:</a> OS stands for operating system. Most gaming PCs will utilize Windows 10 though some people may want to install Linux.</li>
            </ul>
            <h8>Now that you know the parts and their purposes you can now start building you PC.</h8>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1: Prepare your motherboard</li>
                <li>Step 2: Install the CPU</li>
                <li>Step 3: Install M.2 SSD(s)</li>
                <li>Step 4: Install the RAM</li>
                <li>Step 5: Get your case ready for your motherboard</li>
                <li>Step 6: Install your motherboard into your case</li>
                <li>Step 7: Install your power supply (PSU)</li>
                <li>Step 8: Connect any SATA hard drives/SSDs</li>
                <li>Step 9: Plug your case and power cables into the motherboard</li>
                <li>Step 10: Install your CPU cooling system</li>
                <li>Step 11: Start cable management</li>
                <li>Step 12: Install your graphics card</li>
                <li>Step 13: Install your OS</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once you got all the parts together and all the cables are connected you should be good to go.</p>
